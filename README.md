# Project Calamity

In a distant world, a war rages on / 
A battle between science and magic long gone / 
Each side vying for control, for supremacy / 
And in the midst of it all, Project Calamity

A game of strategy, turn-based and bold / 
Where warriors fight and stories unfold / 
With each move, a player's fate is sealed / 
And the fate of the world is revealed

Science brings technology, guns and machines / 
Magic brings spells, incantations, and dreams / 
And as the two sides clash in battle / 
The fate of the world hangs in the balance

The battlefield is where heroes are made / 
Where legends are born and fortunes are paid / 
Each turn, a choice, a path to follow / 
And each choice leads to a brighter tomorrow

Project Calamity, a game of war and might / 
Where players must choose to fight for what's right / 
And as the battle rages on, each move they make / 
Determines the world's destiny, its fate

So let us take up arms and fight / 
For science, for magic, for what's right / 
And let Project Calamity be our guide / 
As we journey forth, side by side.
